<p>A real life example of a variable is the weather. The weather changes and based on the weather your clothes too.</p>

<h2>Function</h2>
<p>Function: a body of code that returns a value.</p>
<p>On python a function may look like: </p>

<p>A real life example of a function is in math, when you enter a variable into the equation to get a result.</p>

<h2>Loop</h2>
<p>Loop:  a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.</p>
<p>On python a loop may look like: </p>

<p>A real life example of a loop is waking up at 7am everyday.It is in a forever loop. </p>

<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<p>Conditionals: features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.</p>
<p>On python a conditional may look like: </p>

<p>A real life example of a conditional is if it is raining then you use an umbrella.</p>
